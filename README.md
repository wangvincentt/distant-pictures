# distant-pictures
A simple server that serves webcam pictures to a website. 

I add signal when clicking buttom, so it does capture images and send it to client side.

Addition: I add jimp package on the code, which can do some image processing.
          In the project, I simplely to process the image to grey scale by clicking the bottom.

I think the grey scale and other image processing tools are interesting and important on dealing with images.
